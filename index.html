        <p>Alright my children, Lets take a quick trip onto the JavaScript Train </p>
        <div id="pilar" class="pilarThree">
            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <p>Lets began our trip together with Functions.</p> 
            <p>They are one the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript.</p> 
            <p>A function is a set of statements or conditionals that performs a certain task.</p>
            <p> To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
            <p><strong>function name(parameters){ console.log("This is a declaration") };</strong></p>
            <p>This is an example of what a function may look like. The function begins with naming of the function.
                    Then it is follwed by a list of parameters, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
                    Lasty, there are JavaScript statements that define the function and are enclosed within curly brackets, { }.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="pilar" class="pilarOne">
            <h3>Objects</h3>
            <p>Next up, we have our Objects.</p> 
            <p>Like in real everyday life, ojects have different properties like weight and color as well as differet methods such as starting and stopping.</p> 
            <p>Objects are like variables. The only differece is onjects contain many values rather than one.</p>
            <p>You create an object like you would a variable by calling a name and asigning it values.</p>
            <p><strong>let garden = {
                    vegetable: 'zucchini',
                    flower: 'sun flower',
                    fruit: 'grape',
                    water: true,
                    sun: true,
                    size: 10,
                };</strong></p>
            <p>This is an example of what an object may look like. Creating an object begins with naming a container and then asigning properties and their values.
                    Objects are extremly useful for storing a lot of data into a single container.
            </p>
            
        </div>
        <div id="pilar" class="pilarTwo">
            <h3>Arrays</h3>
            <p>Lastly, we have found ourselves at the Arrays</p> 
            <p>Arrays are global objects which are just high-level list-like objects</p> 
            <p><strong>let students = ["Tony", "Marshall", "Rhys", "Ray", 23, true];</strong></p>
            <p>This is an example of what an array may look like. Since it's an object, you first began with naming a containter and then asign it just values rather properties and their values.
                Instead of using parentheses () you use brakets []. In JavaScript, seeing brakets is how you know an oject is an array.
